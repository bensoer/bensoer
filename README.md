👋 Hi, I’m @bensoer . A DevOps Engineer, Photographer, Wannabe car guy, and Outdoor Enthusiast. I love building things that help make these things in my world easier and more fun!

🌱 Currently I'm exploring Terraform, Kubernetes, and the various popular tools that go into working and owning a cluster! I'm working to get CKA Certified, and maybe CKAD and CKAS!

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful projects to make our real-world lives easier, as well improve the functionality of existing toolings and frameworks that make our development processes smoother
